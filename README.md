Hey,P4Ul here this is a group project of a team name 404founders. This is to solve a problem statement released by government of punjab during SIH(Smart India Hackathon).
The problem our team has taken is to make a healthcare web app for rural people for nabha.


Our team has deeply researched on the problem statement and decided to make the web app named Telemed.


What Telemed provides??

We provide a healthcare platform where you can login via 2 types ie 1)As A Patient 2)As A Doctor.

After Logiging in if u are a patient u can


1)Book An Appointment.

2)After Booking a Appointment choosing a doctor u would get a time scheduled.

3)U would get a google meet link for the appointment scheduled time.


Now as a Doctor
1)Wait for someone to book 

2)As soon as a booking arrive give a scheduled time 

3)At the scheduled time give the google meet link generated by web app



How to run Telemed?


Run it from the given Vercel link/
Clone the code from git by using git clone

After cloning open terminal in the frontend file name Telemed

Give Commands:npm install

npm run dev

after this 2 simple steps the Frontend is live 

Now cd in the telemed_backend folder to run backend server live

give commands:pip install fastapi uvicorn

uvicorn main:app --reload

After this 2 simple steps the backend would also be live

Now u can use telemed 

I want to thank all the collaborator/group members of my team to make this web app succesfull.
